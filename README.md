# YNAB + AI

Just having fun with GPT-4. Had an idea about feeding my YNAB data (without sensitive financial institution account info, of course) into GPT-4 and asking the model various questions about my finances. Questions like:

- Based on my previous transaction history, do you see anything out of the ordinary?
- Based on these financial goals, what are some actions I could take to meet them?
- ...

Decided to build this with Nuxt3.
